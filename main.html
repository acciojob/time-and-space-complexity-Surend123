	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is amount of time that can be taken by the Algorithm.If Algorithm takes less time so it is efficient algorithm </p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is amount of storage in the memory that can be use by the Data Structure.For Example a array takes n element so it's space complexity is O(n).</p>
